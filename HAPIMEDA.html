                    <p>Hosted by both APIMEDA (Asian Pacific Islander Middle Eastern Desi American) Programs and
                        Services and the LGBT Resource Center, this is a quarterly gathering for LGBTQ APIMEDA
                        identified folks to be in community and meet new people! From discussing the intersections of
                        our identities to having fun as people bond with each other, these gatherings hope to foster a
                        supportive environment where our family can grow and thrive!

                    <p>One of the most important parts of this process is knowing what the community needs and wants.
                        As a queer Asian American myself, I have always wanted a space to meet others like me and I
                        wanted to ensure I would be able to create that space for others as well. Reaching out and
                        connecting with other APIMEDA LGBTQ identified folks, I gathered information on what we could
                        do for the community. I also conducted secondary research to get a scope that was bigger than
                        UCSD and to get the perspectives of those who might not be comfortable sharing their
                        experiences in person.

                    <p>With the information we gathered, we then brainstormed what our event could possibly look like.
                        There were a lot of ideas that we wanted to implement, because there was so much that could be
                        done for the community! But being realistic, we narrowed our event down to focus on first
                        creating a casual and friendly environment for people to meet and make friends. We wanted
                        people to first know that this was a place for them to be themselves and create retention for
                        future events.

                        ; class="ex1"><b>FEEDBACK</b></h2>
                    <p>After bouncing off ideas and possible themes, we then asked for feedback from the community.
                        Because the events would be quarterly, a theme for each one would make each one unique while
                        also attracting people to come back. We also screened our ideas with professional staff from
                        both APIMEDA Programs and Services and the LGBT Resource Center to ensure the work we were
                        doing was inclusive to the community. From the language we used to the activities we hosted, we
                        ensured that what we were doing would facilitate a brave space for the community. Afterwards,
                        we decided a bread party was a fun way to start off the quarter!

                    <p>With planning underway, a big part of this event was reaching out to the people the event was
                        for. Social media and exposure on campus was key to this because not everyone is explicit about
                        their identities and is out. We wanted people to know this was a closed space and that they
                        were safe if they came. We made sure to share our event in places that people in the community
                        would see, reach out to student organizations, post flyers in spaces that were visible to
                        possible attendees, and spread the event via word of mouth. We also ensured that if people saw
                        this event, they would not be outted if they were interested in it.

                    <p>The day of was very successful and encouraging for the future of these events. We had a diverse
                        group of people show up and facilitated a space where people could talk about their identities
                        and make friends! This event really showed me the importance of having community and how much
                        empathy can do for an individual. When the world is not designed for you, the isolation can
                        feel overwhelming and lonely. Itâ€™s a big reason why I really want to pursue design as a career.
                        The little interactions that a person navigates throughout their life has a major impact on
                        them, and I want to ensure that when people do interact with them, they see themselves
                        reflected in it.
