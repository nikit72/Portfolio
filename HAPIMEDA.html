            <p>The design process can be used in many places! I decided to use it to create space for community. Hosted
                by both APIMEDA (Asian Pacific Islander Middle Eastern Desi American) Programs and Services and the
                LGBT Resource Center, this is a quarterly gathering for LGBTQ APIMEDA identified folks to be in
                community and meet new people! From discussing the intersections of our identities to having fun as
                people bond with each other, these gatherings hope to foster a supportive environment where our family
                can grow and thrive!

            <p>One of the most important parts of this process is knowing what the community needs and wants. As a
                queer Asian American myseld, I have always wanted a space to meet others like me and I wanted to ensure
                I would be able to create that space for others as well. Reaching out and connecting with other APIMEDA
                LGBTQ identified folks, I gathered information on what we could do for the community. I also conducted
                secondary research to get a scope that was bigger than UCSD and to get the perspectives of those who
                might not be comfortable sharing their experiences in person.

            <p>With the information we gathered, we then brainstormed what our event could possibly look like. There
                were a lot of ideas that we wanted to implement, because there was so much that could be done for the
                community! But being realistic, we narrowed our event down to focus on first creating a casual and
                friendly environment for people to meet and make friends. We wanted people to first know that this was
                a place for them to be themselves and create retention for future events.

                ; class="ex1"><b>FEEBACK</b></h2>
            <p>After bouncing off ideas and possible themes, we then asked for feedback from the community. Because the
                events would be quarterly, a theme for each one would make each one unique while also attracting people
                to come back. Receiving opinions allowed us to see which ideas would attract more people and what
                behaviors they would create. For this quarter, we decided that we would do a bread party!

                ; class="ex1"><b>MARKETING</b></h2>
            <p>With planning underway, a big part of this event was reaching out to the people the event was for.
                Social media and exposure on campus was key to this because not everyone is explicit about their
                identities and is necessarily open. We wanted people to know this was a closed space and that they were
                safe if they came. We made sure to share our event in places that people in the community would see,
                reach out to student organizations, post flyers in spaces that were visible to possible attendees, and
                spread the event via word of mouth. We also ensured that if people were interested, such as on a
                facebook event, they were not accidentally outed by clicking on it.
