                    <p>Tasked with the goal to enhance recreation, we brainstormed different recreational activities
                        that had needs we could tackle. As all art lovers, we narrowed it to enhancing art forms since
                        we saw many potential areas for improvement in art. To insure that we would have a lot of
                        concepts to work with, we decided to observe and interview people who engaged in three separate
                        art forms: comedy, dance, and visual arts. While they do vary drastically in how they are
                        performed, observing activities which such distinctions would allow us to explore many needs,
                        as well as see their potential overlap.

                    <p>Art is such a diverse topic! And we wanted to make sure to get those diverse experiences. We
                        began our exploration by observing and interviewing people in order to view art in their eyes.
                        Having both observations and interviews allowed us to see what problems artists were aware of
                        and what problems they might not notice while they create.

                        One of which that caught our attention across the three art forms was the need to map the
                        creative process and keep track of ideas that spur when you least expect it.

                    <p>To get a better sense of how we could target this need, we began to storyboard what a potential
                        user’s creative process might look like. This would give more insight on their behaviors and
                        actions when a problem might occur.

                    <p>One insight we found really changed how we wanted to target the user’s needs. Not only did we
                        want our app to help organize the creative process, we wanted to insure that our user would
                        stay inspired and motivated as they created as that had a big impact on their work.

                    <p>With our storyboards to guide us, the next step was creating paper prototypes of how the user’s
                        interaction with our app might occur. The creative art process is very abstract and so how we
                        framed our app would have to fit that unique experience while having a uniform design for
                        multiple users. Below is an example of a prototype I made.

                    <p>While ideating many different possible pages our app could have, we came up with several main
                        pages and functions. We then created wireframes of the main features of our app to guide us in
                        our functional prototype.

                        ; class="ex1"><b>USER TESTING</b></h2>
                    <p>With our prototypes, we then began to do user testing to see if the functions we added were
                        needed in the first place and if the task flows were intuitive. What we found was the appeal of
                        the sprout page and that some functions were more intuitive than others. These notes helped us
                        understand which functions we had to scaffold for the user and how to improve the user’s
                        interactions with the app. Below are some examples of the changes we made.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded animated fadeIn delay-0.95s" src="images/spnav.png" />

                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <p>One change we made was the navbar. We found that it was better to declutter the navbar by
                        turning the "Plant Project" function into a popup rather than add it via the navbar. We also
                        moved the function next to the home button so people would not mistakenly logout.
                    </p>

                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <p>Another change was scaffolding the "Sprout leaf" function for new users. We found that most
                        users tended to click on the instuction box rather than the button on the navbar. With this
                        information, we decided to turn the description into the button itself. This also encourages
                        people to continue to grow the treeline as the function as now a part of it like a growing
                        tree.

                    <p>To ensure that our redesign of the "Sprout Leaf" function was indeed needed, we then tested the
                        2 versions to see which would be more intuitive for the users. With A/B testing, we found that
                        the redesign decreases
                        the time it take for the new user to click on the function, which was our goal.
