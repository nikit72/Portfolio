                    <p>To get a deeper understanding of our project, one of the first steps we took was interviewing and observing our stakeholders. This allowed us to grasp the needs of the possible users of our product and ensure that we had everyone’s perspective, especially when there were conflicting ideas. With this information, we then conducted a stakeholder analysis to see who would play the most crucial roles and how to interact with each stakeholder. This was really important because while some had higher power in the project, they weren’t the main users of our product.

                        ; class="ex1"><b>IDEATION</b></h2>
                    <p>Once we had a better idea of how the PAL Program functioned and their initiatives, we then created an impact gap canvas with secondary research. This canvas highlights three things: the formation of the problem, the solution landscape, and why there is a gap between the problem and solution.

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <p>With this in mind, we then began to ideate on possible ways to fill that gap and fulfill our client’s wish. We wanted to think big at first, explore all possible solutions, before we then started to apply the constraints given to us. This was really helpful in opening our eyes to concepts that we wouldn’t have thought of for our product if we had solely focused on a website as a solution.

                        ; class="ex1"><b>DECISION MATRIX</b></h2>
                    <p>While ideating different ways we could tackle the needs of our users, we eventually focused on three possible solutions: a hard coded site, a learning management system, or a site builder. For us, the backend was essential to what solution we would provide as we wanted our product to be sustainable in the future. While tutors were the main users of the information on our product, the PAL Program leaders would be the ones to produce the material on the site. While looking into it, we then created a decision matrix to ensure we would be providing the client with the details that were most important to their needs.

                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <p>We also updated our stakeholders on the solutions we were looking into to ensure they were on board. We found that the Google Classroom, a learning management system, would be able to provide the client with what the need best.

                        ; class="ex1"><b>USER TESTING</b></h2>
                    <p>Once we solidified our prototype as the Google Classroom, we observed our potential users, mainly the tutors and PAL Program leaders, interact with the website. This was a great opportunity to see the product from the perspective of our users. We then created a feedback capture grid to see what could be improved and implemented into our final prototype.

                    <p>Once we incorporated our changes, we then analyzed how well we completed our design requirements for our clients. With this, we made a few more tweaks and delivered our product that would be both sustainable and accessible for the tutoring program now and into the future as they grow!
