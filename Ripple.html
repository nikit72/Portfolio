                    <p>There aren’t many mobile apps that focus on people between the ages 50-80, so with that goal in
                        mind, we first
                        researched
                        and brainstormed as many problem spaces we could target.
                        As we entered deeper discussion, we decided to focus our attention on increasing the quality of
                        life of
                        people in their retirement. We found that retired
                        members of society often had difficulty adjusting to the change in lifestyle and that this
                        could
                        lead
                        to other problems in their lives. With this in mind,
                        we wanted to create a solution through our app that encourages our users to try new things and
                        learn
                        new skills.

                    <p>In order to understand the behaviors and needs of our users, we began to create personas and
                        storyboards
                        that would delve into the nuances of their everyday
                        life. Through our storyboards, we discovered issues our users might face when using technology,
                        why
                        they might lose motivation in their goals, and what
                        interactions might impact their lives and what they do. This was a very eye-opening process for
                        me,
                        especially as a college student trying to better empathize
                        with an older generation. Much of daily technology is not designed for our users and we wanted
                        to
                        ensure they didn’t feel that way when they use ours.

                    <p>Before prototyping, we decided we would focus on skill sharing, companionship, and traveling as
                        our
                        main
                        avenues to encourage our users to try new things.
                        With these concepts at the forefront and interface up to interpretation, we came up with
                        several
                        diverse paper prototypes that maximized our creative ideas.
                        With our various visions, we were able to organize which ideas and designs would best fit our
                        goal
                        for
                        this project. Below is an example of a prototype I ideated.

                    <p>After discussing the pros and cons of our prototypes, we also took a step back to think
                        about
                        what
                        needs
                        we were really trying to solve with our app.
                        We wanted to make sure we were thinking of our users first and foremost. With a fresh
                        new
                        perspective,
                        we decided to narrow our idea to a bucket list
                        app and create a cohesive digital prototype.

                        were and
                        what
                        possible issues our users might run into.
                        This also provided us an opportunity to receive differing ideas on how to improve the
                        usability
                        and
                        functionality of our app. We decided on a few major
                        changes on our main pages to ensure that going back to forth between pages was
                        intuitive while
                        removing
                        a few functions that we found to be unnecessary.

                        helped shape a lot of the changes we made. We made our navbar consistent on all screens to
                        avoid confusing the user when switching screens. We also avoided using only icons by including
                        text for users who might not know what those icons mean. In order to ensure our users could
                        read the text on small screens, we increased the default text size and choose an easy to read
                        font. Another change was using bold colors for important functions to help guide our users to
                        those information and functions.
